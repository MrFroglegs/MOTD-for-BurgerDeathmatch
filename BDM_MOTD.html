						<h2>How To Play</h2>
            <hr>
  					<h3>What is 'Fight to Survive'?</h3>
            <b>Fight To Survive is a combination of endless fast-paced deathmatch and King of the Hill.</b>
						<ul>

							<h3>Deathmatching:</h3>
            <b>The core element of this gamemode.</b>
    					<li>Kill other players to earn EXP using a variety of weapons at your disposal.</li>
    					<li>Performing multi-kills and killing sprees will earn you bonus EXP.</li>
              <li>You can carry up to 50 Kg of equipment. The heavier your loadout, the slower your mobility.</li>
    					<li>You can pick up dropped weapons and ammo pouches by pressing <good>E</good>.</li>
              <li>You can create or join a team at any time. Your teammate's location and current HP will appear on your HUD. See the <good>Controls Section</good> below.</li>  
							
							<h3>King of the Hill point capture:</h3>
            <b>The secondary element of this gamemode.</b>
  						<li>Hold down Control Points to become the <meh>King</meh>. As long as you remain on the point, you will earn EXP, replenish ammunition and 3 Health Points every second to a maximum of 300 HP. </li>
    					<li>Stepping out of the point that you control leaves it open for other players to steal. You will also stop earning the bonuses listed above untill you return to the point.</li>
  						<li>If another player takes control of the point you were holding, they will become <meh>King</meh> and any bonus HP you have earned will go to them.</li>
              <li><b>Control points change every 5 minutes.</b> To remain <meh>King</meh>, head to the next point before another player takes control.</li>
						</ul>
